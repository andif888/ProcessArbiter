			<P>This help collection gives you an overview over the features and their usage of 
				ProcessArbiter.</P>
			<H2>What is ProcessArbiter?</H2>
			<P>ProcessArbiter boosts the agility of a Windows Operating System when 
			running multiple applications. </P>
			<P>On a single desktop for example you can run multiple 
			applications (backup, CD-burning, video encoding) which consumes many CPU resources 
			in the background. At this moment other application you are trying to run are normally very 
			unresponsive, because the CPU resources are exhausted. ProcessArbiter dynamically 
			adjusts priorities at which an application gets CPU times. This means for example your video encoding 
			application gets dynamically a lower priority. If there is no application which requests CPU time at the moment, your 
			video encoding application can still run on full speed. If you run now an application which currently requests CPU time, 
			it immedially gets scheduled because of its higher priority. Your PC is much more responsive.</P>
			<P>In <b>Terminal Server environments</b> (server based computing), when multible users are working with multible application on 
			one Microsoft Windows Server at the same time, ProcessArbiter can show at its best. 
			ProcessArbiter manages priorities of all running application dynamically and fully automated. The users running the 
			terminal sessions will immediately recognize the more snappier behavior and responsiveness of their applications. 
			Administrators can easily run scheduled tasks during work hours without interferring user sessions. </P>
			<P>The best news is, that there is no complicated configuration in ProcessArbiter. 
			After installation, which is a 5 seconds task, ProcessArbiter will do its job. It is implemented 
			as reliably Windows Service with nearly no overhead.
